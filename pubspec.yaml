# DB choice: sqflite (SQLite)
# Why sqflite over Isar/Hive/Drift:
# - Most mature and battle-tested SQLite wrapper for Flutter
# - No code generation step (unlike Drift/Isar) = faster iteration for MVP
# - SQLite is the gold standard for offline-first mobile apps
# - Simple API, excellent documentation, predictable behavior
# - Isar is being sunset; Hive lacks relational queries we need for
#   course->assignment->block relationships
# - sqflite gives us JOIN capability for future queries if needed
